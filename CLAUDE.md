I want to create a chatbot for RedHat ACM users that can use :
- ACM Search MCP Server (using sse) for now. Refer: https://github.com/stolostron/acm-mcp-server/blob/main/servers/postgresql/k8s/README.md or ~/code/acm-mcp-server/servers/postgresql/k8s/README.md
- Will add other MCP Servers at a later stage.

I want to use langgraph. Use this as a reference - https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/agents/mcp/#use-mcp-tools

A streamlit UI would be a good start.
